Glossary,http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/srt_0000001,"terms and their definitions, possibly with synonyms - example, NSIDC's Cryosphere Glossary https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glossary",
Thesaurus,http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/srt_0000002,"a structured controlled vocabulary where there is information about each term and its hierarchical, associative, or equivalence relationships to other terms in the thesaurus",
Ontology,http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/srt_0000003,"a set of concepts with attributes and relationships between the concepts which together define a domain of knowledge, expressed in machine-readable format",
Controlled Vocabulary,http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/srt_0000004,"a list of terms controlled by some authority, generally intended to populate pick lists in user interfaces. Assumption is that users will all understand the terms without any additional guidance.",
Taxonomy,http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/srt_0000005,"hierarchies of terms organized as tree structures without significant relationships to concepts in other trees - example, oak and elm are both types of trees",

RDF Vocabulary,http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/srt_0000007,"A representation of a knowledge domain that defines rdf classes and attributes, along with domain and range constraints for some attributes.  Distinguish from ontology by absence of general class relationships, and restrictions offered by representations like OWL.",
SKOS Vocabulary,http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/srt_0000008,"A collection of concepts with identifiers, preferred labels, and definitions; include broader, narrower, related and transitive relationships, labels in alternate languages, and other annotation properties. Encoded using SKOS rdf vocabulary. Note Glossary, Taxonomy,  and Thesaurus might be represented using SKOS vocabulary, but lack one or more of the semantic enhancments offered by SKOS.",
