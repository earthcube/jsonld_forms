Resource Type,Scope Note,URI
Bundled Object,"A composite resource that is a collection of other resources assembled into a package for some purpose, and accessible as a single Unit. Examples include Docker containers; Bagit, Data on the Web, or ORE packages with heterogeneous content. ",http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/SFO_0000075
Catalog/Registry,"A curated collection of descriptions of resources, accessible through one or more interfaces.  The actual collection of resource descriptions (metadata) is a kind of dataset, and the access interfaces would be services; technically a catalog would be a bundled dataset (the metadata collection) and one or more services. Implicitly there is also a stewardship/policy component determining management of the catalog.",http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/ECRRO_0000212
Dataset,"A collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more representations.",http://schema.org/Dataset
Interchange file format,"A serialization scheme (data format) for communication between agents. Most general types are generic formats specified by typical MIME types, but this resource type includes much more granular identification of schemes/Data Types/Data Specification that are specific to particular applications. These generally implement some underlying information model (schema and vocabulary) that enables semantic as well as syntactic interoperability.  An Interchange Format SHOULD have an associated specification that documents its provisions and usage. Registered interchange formats are intended to provide identifiers for data serialization formats that work with specific applications. Links to registered formats would be via URI values for the inputFormat and outputFormat properties on an Interface/API, Software, or Service resource.  In situations where no specification resource is available to document the format, it is sufficient to simply identify the format as an application specific format. This is the case for various commercial applications that use proprietary formats, as well as for scientific model input and output formats. The interchange format can be linked to an information model that defines the entities and properties represented using the format.   The token (string) to identify a file format either in schema:DataDownload/encodingFormat or in schema:DataFeed input encodingFormat should be populated in the interchange file format ecrr external identifer field.",http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/ECRRO_0000208
Interface/API,"A set of operations, messages used to invoke the operations, and inputs necessary to execute the operations, along with an expected output content and format. An Interface/API should have an associated specification document.  ",http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/ECRRO_0000207
Platform,"A composite software entity that enables execution of a variety of tools e.g. MatLab, ArcGIS. Key defining feature is extensibility with plugin architecture and API-based interaction between components to enable reconfiguration/extension for new problems.",http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/ECRRO_0000211
Repository,"a storage system in which objects may be stored for subsequent access or retrieval (generalize from Kahn and Wilensky, 1995, http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/k-w.html)",http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/ECRRO_0000209
Semantic Resource,"A specification of concepts, and optionally relationships representing a conceptualization of some domain of discourse.  Includes a spectrum of resources including controlled vocabulary, thesaurus, information model, taxonomy, glossary, vocabulary....). For linked data purposes, it is useful to specify the entities and properties of the entities represented by the model using URI references to widely used ontologies. For discovery purposes in the registry, the entities and properties should be described in English language terms. ",http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/ECRRO_0000210
Service Instance,"A software entity on one side of an interface that executes some kind of processing  in response to a request made by an agent on the other side of the interface. The service presents a set of offerings, each of which entails a resource and one or more operations on that resource. Each offering also specifies the interchange format for input and output, and the syntax for invoking the operations, including any parameters in the operation signature.  ",http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/ECRRO_0000202
Software,"a packaged set of instructions that can be executed by a machine to perform one or more functions. Distribution might be as source code, an executable file, an installer package, or as a web application that can be invokee via URL. ",http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/ECRRO_0000206
Specification,"A document that describes the technical characteristics of an artifact or practice, possibly including a description of what it should do, or an explicit set of requirements that it must satisfy. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification.  e.g. interoperability agreement, identifier scheme.  All resources may have a conformsTo property that should be a link to a specification.  Specifications may be hierarchical, e.g. a profile specification might inherit provisions from a parent specification, and add additional constraints to further restrict usage of the artifact or practice.",http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/ECRRO_0000204
Use Case,A specification of a scenario for a work item with some specific context and goal.,http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/ECRRO_0000005
